### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am AdriÃ , a humble person trying to get acquainted with the Data Analytics world through tools like Python and R. I am currently serving as a Teaching Assistant at the Esade Master of Science in Business Analytics in the Data Analytics with R class, so learning everyday about R is absolutely out of the question.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on putting together a comprehensive set of resources for doing machine learning in R, Python and Git.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how software development teams work and how to integrate them in a business environment.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on R and Python coding for machine learning.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with R and its statisical applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about business reserach, agile mindset, innovation management and strategy.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Being a Beatles fan, I was in London for the Abbey Road album 50th anniversary. I was unlucky enough to get to anothe station called Abbey Road at the other extreme of the city in the suburbs and missed all the ceremony ðŸ˜ž
