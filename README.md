### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am AdriÃ , a humble person trying to get acquainted with the Data Analytics world through tools like Python and R. I am currently serving as a Teaching Assistant at the Esade Master of Science in Business Analytics in the Data Analytics with R class, so learning everyday about R is absolutely out of the question.
